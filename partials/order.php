							All orders will be dispatched within 2-3 days of placing the order. We send them via standard courier partners and share a tracking link. Most deliveries happen within 6-10 working days. During Sale days, this might get delayed further.
						</p>

						<p class="stext-113 cl6 p-b-26">
							If we are facing huge demands in production, we might get slightly delayed, as all our products are handmade. But we will try to dispatch the bag as soon as we can, and keep you updated.
						</p>

						<p class="stext-113 cl6 p-b-26">
							If you have any query relating to delivery please email us at online@zouk.co.in, and we will try to respond at the earliest.
						</p>
						<p class="stext-113 cl6 p-b-26">
						Note: If you placed a COD order, there will be a verification call which is mandatory to complete, to process the order. This causes a 1-2 day delay in dispatch. If you want faster delivery, please drop an email to online@zouk.co.in and get the order converted to online prepaid.
